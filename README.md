RaspberryHack
=============

Our project is in **software** category, and is intended to help beginners
learn programming. It provides a text editor where a user can write python
code. We run it in a sandbox and prompt the user with errors (if any). If
all is OK, the result is displayed on the left side using an animation
style.

In order to build a *teaching* example, one has to extend a Level class,
and implement add_objects and check methods. So the developer must
build the internal logic of data structures and add also a checking logic
for the user input code.
